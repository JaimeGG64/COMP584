                    well acquainted
                    with most of the students. He is one of the few characters that always gets along with the girls,
                    and was voted third
                    cutest by them in "The List". He is respected and liked by pretty much everyone.</p>

                    episodes, she generally
                    provides a voice of reason, usually against Eric Cartman, especially in earlier seasons. She is
                    generally friendly to
                    others and seems well-liked at school, but she is unwilling to let her beliefs be compromised by

                    smarter boys, being
                    a straight-A student. Tolkien had a major role in "Here Comes the Neighborhood". Tolkien is being
                    teased by his friends
                    for being rich. For example, he was teased by the kids of South Park for having a DVD player, and
                    not knowing what a VHS
                    was.</p>

                    more recently been
                    expanded, bringing him more screen time and giving his character more depth. In "Professor Chaos",

                    final 10 chosen to be their fourth member, but ultimately he is not picked. In later seasons, he is
