# Accessibility Notes
From the provided tools I was able to checkout VoiceOver, NoCoffee, and Chrome Lighthouse. I was having trouble getting Tota11y to work correctly.

## Pros
### Voice Over
Voice Over works extremely well in Apple Safari. There are quick shortcut keys to get the screen reader to read out all of the contents on the page. There are plenty of configurable options to suit the user. From what I heard, avid user prefer faster speeds. However when demonstrating voice over to a general audience slower speaking speeds are ideal to help people understand the struggles of a visual impaired user.

### NoCoffee
It revelation seeing how other people experiencing visual impairment. It can educate people on why certain design decisions were made. NoCoffee provides visual examples for not a completely blind point-of-view but rather small visual impalements. They range from various level of color blindness, blurry vision, cataracts, glaucoma, floaters, and much more. The level of severity can also be adjust to test out the resiliency of your designs. 

### Chrome lighthouse
Chrome Lighthouse does extreme technical break down which parts of web page meet accessability standards and which parts needs to be updated on a technical level. This can make the process of finding accessability problems more streamline.

## Cons
### Voice Over
Voice Over is a little more difficult to use in other web browser such Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. The same Voice Over shortcuts from Safari does not works in Chrome and Firefox. Also for Voice Over to be the most optimal web page must have a structural semantic html structure. If pages are poorly structure then it would be difficult to follow the content on the pages.

### NoCoffee
NoCoffee is just simulation. Being fortunate person who can see the world, it can be difficult to fully emphasize with people with suffering these visual impairments. It should be noted that people suffering from these visual does not have the same level severity. It can range from being a small nuisance to completely impaired. 

### Chrome lighthouse
If you are a non technical person the information that Lighthouse generate would most likely be difficult to understand. There might be cases where organization rely on easy to use tools that generate inaccessible content. Once Lighthouse audit such content it can be a long difficult to fix all of the content to be accessible. Fix the accessibility problem early before it becomes a larger problem
