                <p class="card__info">Stan is one of the leaders of the male student population in South Park
                    Elementary, and therefore is
                    well acquainted
                    with most of the students. He is one of the few characters that always gets along with the girls,
                    and was voted third
                    cutest by them in "The List". He is respected and liked by pretty much everyone. He also has gone
                    out of his way to make
                    peace with his fellow students, like when he tries to make things right with Tolkien Black.</p>

                <h2 class="card__name">Kyle Broflovski</h2>
                <p class="card__info">Kyle has extremely strong beliefs, and when forced to question them, he becomes
                    very upset and has somewhat of a short
                    temper. For the most part, Kyle bases his decisions on both his emotions and beliefs; therefore, he
                    is easily coaxed
                    into fights or manipulated by his feelings,</p>

                <h2 class="card__name">Eric Theodore Cartman</h2>
                <p class="card__info">Cartman is described in various terms, in short, he is an evil, vicious, angry,
                    self-absorbed, immature, destructive,
                    sarcastic, snooty, loud-mouthed, lazy, and insane child. He is the most foul-mouthed character in
                    the show. He is also
                    racist and stereotypes almost everyone he sees. The very dark, usually disturbing undertones to his
                    personality often
                    hint at an extreme mental imbalance.</p>

                <h2 class="card__name">Kenneth "Kenny" McCormick</h2>
                <p class="card__info">Kenny is most famous for dying in almost every episode in the first five seasons
                    of South Park. He is also easily
                    recognizable for almost always wearing an orange parka, or just having his face hidden, that covers
                    most of his face and
                    muffles his speech. In "Mysterion Rises" Kenny, who is revealed to be the superhero Mysterion,
                    reveals that he has the
                    power of immortality, in a sense, and that he just wakes up in his bed after having died.</p>

                <h2 class="card__name">Wendy Testaburger</h2>
                <p class="card__name">Wendy is best described as a mature and intelligent person whose stubbornness and
                    occasional jealousy
                    sometimes get the
                    best of her; she is typically portrayed as nice, feminine, smart, and liberal in nature. In many
                    episodes, she generally
                    provides a voice of reason, usually against Eric Cartman, especially in earlier seasons. She is
                    generally friendly to
                    others and seems well-liked at school, but she is unwilling to let her beliefs be compromised by
                    popularity. Wendy is
                    shown to be very intelligent and politically aware</p>

                <p class="card__name">Tolkien Black is a regular member of Craig's gang and is most notable for being
                    the only black child in South Park,
                    other than guest characters and Nichole. His birthday is June 20. He is also known to be one of the
                    smarter boys, being
                    a straight-A student. Tolkien had a major role in "Here Comes the Neighborhood". Tolkien is being
                    teased by his friends
                    for being rich. For example, he was teased by the kids of South Park for having a DVD player, and
                    not knowing what a VHS
                    was.</p>

                <p class="card__info">He has a habit of sobbing uncontrollably whenever he witnesses something
                    upsetting. Examples of this are when he hears
                    Cartman singing in "Fourth Grade" when the adults decide to give all of the money they would have
                    spent on Christmas
                    presents for their kids to the Broflovskis in "It's Christmas in Canada", and when he realizes that
                    there was no crystal
                    clear lagoons, treasure, and plunder after he joined Cartman's "Somalian pirate club" in "Fatbeard".
                    This usually gets
                    an angry response from Cartman.</p>

                    It was mentioned by Wendy in "The Hobbit" that she has acne. She wears a red jacket with light gray
                    trim and dark green
                    pants with light gray mittens on her hands. Underneath her jacket, she has been shown to wear a red

                    one of the sweetest, most innocent, and
                    most gullible characters on the show. He is unique because he has the personality of a child, in
                    contrast to the other
                    more cynical, adult-like kids. He is generally much nicer and much more naive than the four main
                    characters,</p>

                    slightly shorter. She is also very
                    similar to Sally Turner; they both have similar color schemes and have similar voices. In the
                    earlier seasons, she wore
                    a purple jacket with dark blue pants. In the later seasons, she wears a navy blue jacket with
                    buttons and mauve trimming
                    at the top instead, mauve gloves, and navy blue pants.</p>

                <h2 class="card__name">Jimmy Valmer</h2>
                <p class="card__name">The humor of Jimmy's character comes from his endless optimism despite his
                    handicap. His disability is not overtly
                    mocked; rather his exaggerated eagerness to be a successful "handi-capable" person. Jimmy's role has
                    more recently been
                    expanded, bringing him more screen time and giving his character more depth. In "Professor Chaos",
                    he is one of the
                    final 10 chosen to be their fourth member, but ultimately he is not picked. In later seasons, he is
                    shown hanging with
                    Craig's Gang.</p>

                <p class="card__info">Craig seems to be the most stoic, cynical, apathetic, and deadpan kid in South
                    Park, having a more abrasive personality
                    than the rest of the characters, a trait exaggerated by his deeper-than-average voice. He has been
                    described as
                    pragmatic, monotone, and sarcastic. He also appears to be more logical and mature than some of his
                    peers, typically
                    being the one to call them out on their ignorance. He generally prefers to be left alone, harboring
                    very few but simple
                    interests.</p>

                    time his character has become described
                    less as such and more often as "disabled". In various episodes (such as "Up the Down Steroid") he
                    appears to be quite
                    cognizant, intelligent and principled. In "Cripple Fight", and "Make Love, Not Warcraft", he appears
                    to have no trouble
                    operating a computer.</p>

                    complete. This, in addition to his general forgetfulness and lack of focus, has given him the
                    reputation of being highly
                    unreliable. Apart from being easily excitable and prone to panicking.</p>
